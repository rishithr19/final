<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-affects-personal-loan-acceptance">What Affects Personal Loan Acceptance?</h2>
<p>This project analyzes factors influencing personal loan acceptance using data from <strong>Kaggleâ€™s Bank Personal Loan Modelling</strong> dataset, which includes information on <strong>5,000 customers</strong>, such as age, income, education level, and mortgage status. The analysis models the likelihood of loan acceptance as a function of these variables, revealing that <strong>customers with higher income and education levels</strong> are more likely to accept a loan.</p>
<p>In America, personal loans are a common financial product for various purposes, and understanding factors like age, income, education, and mortgage status helps assess loan acceptance risk. <strong>Age</strong> reflects life stage, <strong>income</strong> indicates repayment ability, <strong>education</strong> correlates with financial literacy and earning potential, and <strong>mortgage status</strong> shows existing commitments.</p>
<p>The project uses <strong>3D scatter plots</strong> to visualize relationships between variables and loan acceptance, and a <strong>statistical model</strong> predicts the probability of loan acceptance based on these factors.</p>
