# **Project Information**

## What Affects Personal Loan Acceptance? 

This project analyzes factors influencing personal loan acceptance using data from **Kaggleâ€™s Bank Personal Loan Modelling** dataset, which includes information on **5,000 customers**, such as age, income, education level, and mortgage status. The analysis models the likelihood of loan acceptance as a function of these variables, revealing that **customers with higher income and education levels** are more likely to accept a loan.

In America, personal loans are a common financial product for various purposes, and understanding factors like age, income, education, and mortgage status helps assess loan acceptance risk. **Age** reflects life stage, **income** indicates repayment ability, **education** correlates with financial literacy and earning potential, and **mortgage status** shows existing commitments.

The project uses **3D scatter plots** to visualize relationships between variables and loan acceptance, and a **statistical model** predicts the probability of loan acceptance based on these factors.
